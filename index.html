    <b>Unit 1: Digital Information</b>
    <hr>
    <p>This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers. Learn how complex information like numbers, text, images, and sound are represented in text, how compression works, and the broader social impacts of digitizing the world's information. It also introduces students to the concept of digital information by exploring how computers represent, store, and transmit data. The unit covers topics such as binary numbers, digital images, compression, encryption, and the impact of digital information on society. Through interactive activities and projects, students learn foundational concepts in computer science while gaining an understanding of how information is processed and manipulated in digital environments.</p>

    <b>Unit 2: The Internet</b>
    <hr>
    <p>This unit reveals how the Internet was designed to connect billions of devices and people to one another. Learn how the different protocols of the Internet work and actually build them yourself using the Internet Simulator. Then consider the impacts the Internet has had, both good and bad, on modern life. Also introduces students to the fundamentals of the Internet, including its structure, function, and impact on society. Students learn about concepts such as IP addresses, DNS, routers, protocols, and the World Wide Web. They explore how data is transmitted over the Internet and how web pages are created and accessed. Through hands-on activities and projects, students gain a deeper understanding of how the Internet works and its significance in today's interconnected world.</p>

    <b>Unit 3: Intro to App Design</b>
    <hr>
    <p>This unit is an introduction to programming and app design with a heavy focus on important skills like debugging, pair programming, and user testing. Learn how to design user interfaces and write event-driven programs in App Lab and then design a project that teaches your classmates about a topic of your choosing. Teaches students the basics of designing and creating mobile applications. Students learn about user interface design, user experience principles, and the process of app development. They explore concepts such as user input, variables, conditionals, and event handling to build interactive and engaging apps. Through hands-on projects using block-based programming languages like Scratch or Blockly, students design and develop their own simple mobile apps, gaining valuable skills in problem-solving, creativity, and computational thinking.</p>

    <b>Unit 4: Variables, Conditionals, and Functions</b>
    <hr>
    <p>This unit explores how variables, conditionals, and functions allow for the design of increasingly complex apps. Learn how to program with these three new concepts through a sequence of collaborative activities. Then build your own decision maker app to share with friends and help them make a decision. Teaches students fundamental programming concepts to create more sophisticated programs. Students learn about variables, which store data, conditionals, which allow for decision-making in code execution, and functions, which organize code into reusable blocks. Through interactive activities and projects, students practice using variables to store and manipulate data, conditionals to control the flow of their programs based on certain conditions, and functions to modularize their code and make it more manageable. This unit provides a solid foundation in programming principles essential for building more complex programs and applications.</p>
